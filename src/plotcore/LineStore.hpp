// A line that is already in RAM, held the way DatasetPlot holds one it read.
//
// The Plot tab's model is a file, a thread and a table. What it *does* with a
// line after the elements are in hand is the same question this answers: build
// a LinePyramid once, fold a whole-line summary out of it, and fold a closer
// look when the reader zooms in. The file and the thread are not here, so a
// numpy array -- or any other contiguous buffer of doubles -- can sit where
// a hyperslab used to.
//
// No QObject: the MinGW DLL that PySide paints through cannot link Qt, and a
// signal would have pulled it in. `onChanged` is an ordinary callback.
//
// `values` is borrowed. The store never copies the raw line; the pyramid is
// the copy, at the finest bucket the hold-budget affords. The owner of those
// doubles must keep them alive until clearLines() or the store is destroyed.
